Welcome to Fast5's documentation!
=================================

This package comprises an API to HDF containers used by the research groups
within Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It complements the
`official API <https://github.com/nanoporetech/ont_fast5_api>`_. Reading and
writing of read files can be accomplished as well as reading of bulk .fast5
files.

.. admonition:: Research Release

    Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early
    access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for
    this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers.
    Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be
    implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would
    like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the 
    developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research
    releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore
    Technologies.
